        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These mashed potatoes are too fattening to have on a regular basis. I only make these on holidays, and everyone wonders what's in them that's makes them so rich.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>5 lbs of Red Potatoes (peeled and quartered</li>
            <li>1 cup Heavy Cream</li>
            <li>1/2 cup Butter</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place potatoes in a large pot with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook until fork tender, about 20 minutes. Drain, add butter, and mash using a potato masher, ricer or mixer. Gradually beat in the heavy cream. Serve hot!</li>
